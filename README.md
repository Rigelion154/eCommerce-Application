## About eCommerce Application
The project is developed using [React](https://react.dev/). It is an application designed for purchasing goods, utilizing CommerceTools to create an API client. The project includes registration and authentication using JWT tokens. All product information is obtained through a REST API. Each client has a separate shopping cart, and there is an option to apply a promo code in the cart. Additionally, a 10% discount, obtained through an API, is applied to products that cost more than $500.

The project implements an infinite scroll feature to display the products. Users can also search and filter products based on attributes, price, and name. A global search function is implemented to search for products by name.
