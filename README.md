## About eCommerce Application
The project is developed using [React](https://react.dev/). In the eCommerce Application project, we created an application for purchasing goods using CommerceTools (to create an API client). During the development of the "E-Commerce Application", we set up a development environment. The following pages were created: registration, profile login, product categories and subcategories, product, shopping cart, “About us”, profile, home page.
